# Pong-pygame

This is a protoype of pong built in pygame. This initially created using [TechWithTim's tutorial]([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGTZlnnX3U) to create pong in pygame. I have modified it to utilize classes and my own assets that I found. I have also made a few modifications to how he implements the game.

## Setup
You should only need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then execute `main.py` to run the game.

## Assets
Sound FX: [3 Ping Pong Sounds 8 bit style | OpenGameArt.org](https://opengameart.org/content/3-ping-pong-sounds-8-bit-style)

Font: Bit 5x3 Font [Matt LaGrandeur - Bitfonts](https://www.mattlag.com/bitfonts/)
